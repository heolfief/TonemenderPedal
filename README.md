# Tonemender by runoffgroove.com

Original design here : [runoffgroove.com/tonemender.html](http://runoffgroove.com/tonemender.html)

The Tonemender is a very flexible, yet simple clean boost with a 3-knob tonestack that allows the user to re-create the classic Fender, Marshall and Vox responses.

This repository shares an **SMD version** of the pedal's PCB.
This is the original design, only the PCB layout changed to make it smaller and easier to fit in small pedal's enclosures.
